             "Ever since this movie was released up until now, this movie's still my most-watched and most-favorite movie ever. Because from the storyline, we can see how the four sisters teamed up to sabotage their younger brother's wedding. But rather than sticking and focusing with their plan, it implies that their main target is to fix their trust, love, and care for each other. And also, I realized that we should learn how to accept someone even though he/she's not your favorite/type of the family. And we shouldn't biased someone because we know how it feels to be biased by anyone and it deeply hurts inside. And because if we're feeling biased, sometimes, we feel left out from others and be introverted. That's why we shouldn't lose our trust and care to anyone who's important in our lives just because of their wrongdoings, let's all learn how to accept and forgive someone's mistakes even if it's intentional. This is one of the movies which can turn into a reality story that may happen in our society. Since this is a family comedy movie, for me, this is a well-deserving movie to be praised by viewers. It's completely legit and heartfelt movie I've ever seen in my entire life.”</td>

            “This is one of my most favourite romantic movies. A love story came out of mature mind.10/10. In one way, it isn't a  movie, instead  it's  like watching real life experiences of  couple who become wise with the life experiences. This movie slowly dragged me in, and I became an invisible character in movie, watching everything as it happens. Story is simple yet amazing. In such type of plots, movie makers are prone to fall for cliche melodramatic tricks to make her fall for him again. But it's not the case here. We can understand both the characters's point of views. Both the actors are adorable, they performed superbly, lovely cinematography. Salute to story and dialogue writer. All the song lyrics are in accordance with situation.”</td>

            “I love the film. It signifies the shortcomings from a family in real life. The film brought a nostalgic and memorable life lessons that actually indicates that we should be grateful for our family especially our parents that we should never take them for granted. The film allows the viewers to look back on painful dispute from a family that oftentimes can lead to hatred due to imperfections from the lives of different family. The film was exceptionally great and inspiring cause it actually expresses that every arguments that a family hvae to deal with would always end up finding hope and forgiveness.”</td>
